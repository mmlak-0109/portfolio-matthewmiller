          <p>For this project, I used HTML/CSS, JavaScript, dimple.js, and d3.js to build an interactive visualization from a data-set that contains 1,157 baseball players. The player data includes their handedness (right, left, or both), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs. My visualizations show how the players (grouped by their handedness) compare across their average performance stats, and show how the relationships between players (grouped by their height and weight) compare across their average performance stats.</p>

            For this project, I considered an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. I fleshed out the experiment idea into a fully defined design, analyzed the results, and ultimately recommended not to launch the tested website change. I also proposed a high-level follow-up experiment, including a hypothesis, unit of diversion, and which metrics to measure.

          <p>For this project, I built a "person of interest (POI) classifier" using algorithms from Scikit-learn. The purpose of the project was to use machine learning to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on public Enron financial and email data. I explored and cleaned the data, created new variables, performed feature selection using both univariate and recursive feature selection, and ultimately achieved Precision and Recall scores of 57% and 48% using a tuned AdaBoostClassier algorithm.</p>

          <p>Used R in Rstudio to explore a data set containing financial contributions made by California residents in the 2016 Presidential election. Discovered that, out of the five parties, Democrats swept the field receiving 85% of donations by count and 76% of donations by dollar amount. Almost all of this came from Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.</p>
